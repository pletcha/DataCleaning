This dataset is based on a human activity recognition experiment using samrtphones carried out by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, <em>et al</em> at the SmartLab of the Universita degli Studi di Genova. (<a href="mailto:activityrecognition@smartlab.ws">Contact</a>). A summary of this experiment follows.

The original experiment was carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity readings were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The original experiments were video-recorded to label the data activity manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals consisted of 128 individual readings per 2.56 second sliding window. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. These variables were a series of statistical measures including various means, standard deviations, etc. In total, 561 distinct variables (referred to as "features") were gathered for each window for each volunteer.

The dataset in this exercise consists of further sttistical calculations (all mean calculations)
